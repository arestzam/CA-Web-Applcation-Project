<h2> 10K Race Overview</h2>

The 10K run is a long-distance road running competition over a distance of ten kilometres (6.2 miles). 
Also referred to as the 10K road race, 10 km, or simply 10K, it is one of the most common types of road running event, 
alongside the shorter 5K and longer half marathon and marathon. It is usually distinguished from the 10,000 metres track running
