A half marathon is a road running event of 21.0975 km (13 mi 192½ yd)—half the distance of a marathon. 

The Half Marathon finishes near the small village of Dunquin outside the door of Kruger’s Pub!  What better place to finish?  Half Marathon finishers </br>
take the opportunity to enjoy a well-deserved refreshment at Kruger’s Pub before returning by complimentary buses which are laid on to return them to Dingle Town, to continue the celebrations 
and welcome home the Full Marathon participants. </br>We were the proud winners of the ‘Half Marathon of the Year’ in 2015, 2016 and again in 2017 in the Running in Ireland Race Awards.
