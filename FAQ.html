Water stations – There are 8 water stations at approximately 3 mile intervals, however the physical layout of the roads 
does not allow them to be exactly every 3 miles. 

They are located at miles 3, 5.5, 8.5, 12, 15.5, 18, 21, 22.7. Toilets are also positioned at all these stations.
 
In addition to water, jellies and bananas are on mile 9 with jellies, bananas, Lucozade Sport and energy gels on mile 21.

 
Do not throw bottles or rubbish over fences or walls, dispose of litter responsibly after each water stop at bins provided 200 metres 
beyond each water station or else drop your rubbish at the next mile marker. Be particularly careful disposing of gel wrappers. 
Please respect the environment you are in.

way to enjoy the scenery in all its glory.

think you can complete it within the above times.

<p><br><font color = "#099329">Question 12: How can i withdraw or swap the race type? </font></br>
We have set up a transfer system to go some way to stop unregulated number swapping. Number swapping can cause medical problems on race day 
and any runner to be found unlawfully swapping their number will be banned from all future races. You can transfer your place to another runner 
looking to run in the same race as you entered. We do not allow runners to transfer between races for the health and safety of all our participants. 

Supplies are allocated per race, if we allow runners to move between races then one race would have over supply in one race and the under supply 
in another race. When organizing a large scale running event race supplies (t-shirts, medals etc etc) are specific to the race and are organized 
and ordered months in advance.
