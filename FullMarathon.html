<h2> The Dingle Full Marathon Race Overview</h2>
<p><br>
The marathon is a long-distance race, completed by running, walking, or a run/walk strategy. There are also wheelchair divisions.

<p><br>
The Full Marathon continues north and east from Dunquin through to wild open countryside, moving inland to the village of Ballyferriter.
The spectacular scenery continues to keep the spirits alive and once you are through the beautiful village of Ballyferriter, your journey</br> 
continues on with some very special views of Murreagh. A challenging part of the course lies ahead, with a tough uphill climb around mile 22
so be prepared to keep some fuel in the tank. Once you have conquered this section, you will be at a point where you can see over the entire landscape,</br> 
covering a long straight stretch before returning to the finish line at the Dingle Marina. </p>
The Full Marathon has a number of challenging sections but it is however a hugely rewarding achievement.</br>
